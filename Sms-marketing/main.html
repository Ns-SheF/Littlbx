    <h1>RYOIKI TENKAI ~___~ DOMAIN EXPANSION</h1>

    <p>
        <span>HI!</span> You ever had those moments where you had to be away from social media 
        because...: ~
        <ul>
            <li>YOU wanted more free time? or </li>
            <li>YOU had an exam/test you were to study for? or </li>
            <li>YOU became too addicted to the screen, so you wanted a break?
                Some fresh air! or
            </li>
            <li>YOU had a goal you wanted to achieve?</li>
            <li>OR YOU JUST WANTED TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH A LOVED ONE?</li>
        </ul>
        There are so many reasons that could make you go away; to take a break. <br>
        And I could bet it'll be quite hard for you to say you've never had those <br>
        moments before. But No! Gambling is unhealthy! No bets...

        <summary>So why am I bringing this up?</summary>

        <p>
            Well... <br>
            I've had a couple of these scenarios where a person had been away <br>
            and then comes back later and requests I resend to them as much possible <br>
            of the previous broadcast messages as I can. -- They prolly lost messages or sth. IDK <br>            
        </p>

        <p>
            And I thought, why not send it to them even when they're unavailable on <br>
            their social? In a way they get to appreciate the little humor as they go about <br>
            they daily un and dowps of life.
        </p>

            <details>

             I've tried it with a few people; you might have received it sometime ago <br>
             Soooo, yes. I've gotten a reliable SMS provider and all is set!

    <h3> But What Is The Catch? Is There A Catch?</h3>
    <p>
        <em>There is a catch, yes! You'll have to pay.</em>
        Ahhh - Yess! --Money* Owo | Kudi | Ego          <em>[evil smile-evil laugh]</em><br><br>

        Okay, wait. Hear me out! <br>
        You're paying for the cost of the SMS, not me. <br>
        It won't be nice to charge you just because you chose to read stuff <br>
        that makes you smile.
